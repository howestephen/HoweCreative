# ROADMAP

## Current Milestone

`3.0 Validate and ship the career-focused editorial redesign`

The work is happening on `claude/concept-editorial`. This branch is intended to
replace the current production design on `main` once its content, CV, responsive
behaviour, and conversion paths are approved.

## Goal

- Make Stephen’s value legible to a hiring manager or client in seconds.
- Lead with outcomes, career evidence, and systems thinking rather than theme.
- Support Creative Technologist, AI Designer, and Design Engineer applications.
- Provide an ATS-readable, printable CV that any visitor can save as a PDF.
- Keep the work visually distinctive through a restrained editorial system and
  the generative plotter mark.

## Completed on the redesign branch

- ✓ Employer-focused positioning and light-first editorial art direction.
- ✓ Outcome-first index for nine case studies.
- ✓ Solana Diary and agentic portfolio case studies.
- ✓ Full 2005–present career history.
- ✓ Standalone `/cv` route with print / save-as-PDF control.
- ✓ Contact form replacing the public email address.
- ✓ SEO, social metadata, favicon, and structured person data.
- ✓ Browser-compatible Web3Forms free-plan submission.
- ✓ Lazy-load the standalone CV route.

## Current Next Steps

1. End-to-end responsive and accessibility QA of the editorial homepage.
2. Verify `/cv` printing and PDF export in Chromium, Safari, and mobile layouts.
3. Review every career claim, date, metric, and case-study outcome for accuracy.
4. Test the production contact flow with the Vercel `EMAIL_ACCESS_KEY`.
5. Review initial bundle composition and defer below-fold work where it improves
   loading without weakening the first impression.
6. Remove deprecated components and dependencies only after the replacement
   design is approved, so rollback remains simple.
7. Merge the approved branch to `main` and validate the production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A first-time visitor can answer who Stephen is, what he does, what proves it,
  and how to contact him from the opening viewport.
- Case studies expose meaningful detail with keyboard and touch input.
- The page remains understandable with animation disabled.
- `/cv` is readable on screen and exports cleanly without site chrome.
- Contact submission succeeds in production and fails with a useful message.
- Tests, typecheck, lint, and production build pass.
- No redesign-specific regressions remain at common phone, tablet, and desktop
  widths before merge.

## Adjacent System Boundary

The Solana publishing pipeline is represented here as portfolio content. Its
Railway, Postgres, Telegram, and X runtime remains a separate deployable and
must not be coupled to the Vercel portfolio.
